# ChatBot

ChatBot made by JrM for a school project @ITC's coding Bootcamp.

This chatbot will handle information about differents topics when properly asked. This means no bad language, and keywords can
be placed in a full sentence:

- help: reveal the full list of keywords,
- weather: fetch tomorrow's forecast and the day after (API),
- jokes: display a random joke (API),
- movies: display the plot of a movie,
- Filter bad language,
- a few more easter eggs.
